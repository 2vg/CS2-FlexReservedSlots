### Configuration Options

#### Flag Sets

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Name` | Unique name for the flag set |
| `Flags` | List of flags that belong to this set |
| `Priority` | Priority level (higher number = higher priority) |
| `AlwaysImmune` | If true, players with these flags will never be kicked |

#### Slot Configurations

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FlagSetName` | Name of the flag set this slot configuration uses |
| `SlotCount` | Number of slots reserved for this configuration |
| `EnabledMaps` | List of maps where this slot is enabled (empty = all maps) |
| `DisabledMaps` | List of maps where this slot is disabled |
| `EnabledEvents` | List of events where this slot is enabled (empty = all events) |
| `DisabledEvents` | List of events where this slot is disabled |

#### General Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Reserved Slots Method` | `0` - There will always be one slot open. For example, if your maxplayers is set to 10, the server can have a maximum of 9 players. If a 10th player joins with a Reservation flag/role, it will kick a player based on the Kick type. If the 10th player doesn't have a reservation flag/role, they will be kicked |
| | `1` - Maintains the number of available slots according to the reservation slots setting, allowing only players with a Reservation flag/role to join. For example, if you have maxplayers set to 10 and Reserved slots set to 3, when there are 7/10 players on the server, additional players can only join if they have a Reservation flag/role. If they don't, they will be kicked. If the server is already full and a player with a Reservation flag/role attempts to join, it will kick a player based on the Kick type |
| | `2` - It works the same way as in method 2, except players with a Reservation flag/role are not counted towards the total player count. For example, if there are 7/10 players on the server, and Reserved slots are set to 3. Out of those 7 players, two players have a Reservation flag/role. The plugin will then consider that there are 5 players on the server, allowing two more players without a Reservation flag/role to connect. If the server is already full and a player with a Reservation flag/role attempts to join, it will kick a player based on the Kick type |
| `Leave One Slot Open` | Works only if reserved slots method is set to 1 or 2. If set to `true`, there will always be one slot open. (`true` or `false`) |
| `Kick Reason` | Reason for the kick (Use the number from [NetworkDisconnectionReason](https://docs.cssharp.dev/api/CounterStrikeSharp.API.ValveConstants.Protobuf.NetworkDisconnectionReason.html?q=NetworkDisconnectionReason)) |
| `Kick Delay` | This means that the player will be kicked after a certain time (`seconds`) (value less than 1 means the player will be kicked immediately) |
| `Kick Check Method` | When a player will be selected for kick when a player with a Reserved flag/role joins? |
| | `0` - When a player with a Reserved flag/role joins |
| | `1` - When a player with a Reserved flag/role choose a team |
| `Kick Type` | How is a players selected to be kicked? |
| | `0` - Players will be kicked randomly |
| | `1` - Players will be kicked by highest ping |
| | `2` - Players will be kicked by highest score |
| | `3` - Players will be kicked by lowest score |
| `Kick Players In Spectate` | Kick players who are in spectate first? (`true` or `false`) |
| `Log Kicked Players` | (`true` or `false`) |
| `Display Kicked Players Message` | Who will see the message when a player is kicked due to a reserved slot |
| | `0` - None |
| | `1` - All players |
| | `2` - Only Admins with the `@css/generic` flag |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `css_event <event_name>` | Set the current event (e.g., "tournament") |
| `css_event none` | Clear the current event |
| `css_rs_status` | Show the status of all slot configurations |

### ConVar Integration

The plugin exposes ConVars that can be modified by other plugins or through the server console:

| ConVar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `css_rs_current_event` | Current event name |
| `css_rs_slot_<name>_enabled` | Enable/disable a slot configuration (1=enabled, 0=disabled) |
| `css_rs_slot_<name>_maps` | Comma-separated list of maps where the slot is enabled |
| `css_rs_slot_<name>_disabled_maps` | Comma-separated list of maps where the slot is disabled |
| `css_rs_slot_<name>_events` | Comma-separated list of events where the slot is enabled |
| `css_rs_slot_<name>_disabled_events` | Comma-separated list of events where the slot is disabled |
